  <H1> What is cyber security?</H1>
<p style="font-size: 160%;">Cyber security is the application of technologies, processes and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and their data from cyber-attacks. It's 
  core function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops and so on) and services we access online and at work.</p>
  <h1> Why is it important?</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 160%;">As the modern world becomes more and more advanced our reliance on technology increases, it is a fundamental part of modern life. From social media, communication
     and entertainment to online banking and shopping. According to research as of January 2023 there were 5.16 internet users worldwide which is 64.4% of the global population and 4.76 social
     media users so as the world relies on internet and technology for almost everything so there need to be a way to ensure safety and security, cyber security is the answer to this.
